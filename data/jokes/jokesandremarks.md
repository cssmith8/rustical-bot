What do you call a creeper with a bomb in his hands?\nIt doesn't matter; he will be blown to smithereens!
An early example of the calibre of jokes we'll be receiving. Note the artwork, worthy of being hung next to a Rembrandt.\nJust kidding it's trash.
**First player:** "Did you hear about the player who thought the creeper was giving out free hugs?"\n**Second player:** "No, what happened?"\n**First player:** "He went _KABOOM_!"
Why the hell would anyone think a green moss monster is giving out hugs? Is it a prostitute creeper?\n...there better not be Rule 34 of creepers
Knock, knock.\n**Who's there?**\nHand granade.\n**Hand grenade who?**\n*Kaboom!*
i'm already deeply regretting spending $5 on this
A blaze swooped in with fireballs blazing.\nSome cows nearby were grazing.\nThe blaze was caught in a trap,\nHe most surely did snap,\nAnd the explosion was quite amazing.
Metrically it leaves little to be desired, and it's pretty tame subject matter. Shame you can't print "Man from Nantucket" in a children's book.\n...that metrical comment is gonna get me on r/iamverysmart, isn't it
Watch where you travel.\nBeware, don't step on gravel.\nIt's a booby trap!
I can haiku too\nBut haikus are meant to be\nAbout the wondrous world
Beware, be careful.\nBooby traps are hidden here.\nAnd there, and there, too!
Haikus of Minecraft\nGive me such indigestion\nPlease no more of these
Did you hear that sound?\nOh no, a ticking time bomb!\nLast sound was kaboom!
Not content with crimes against humour, now the book is attacking the art of poetry itself
There once was a player named Nero.\nHe wanted to feel like a hero.\nHe bombed a hostile mob\nAnd made this his job.\nHis chances were greater than zero!
Nero then had his mother stabbed and played the fiddle as Rome burned
I take just four seconds to explode. What am I?\nTNT!
...are these even riddles, or just literal facts about the game
Think back and recall\nThe first time you played Minecraft.\nWe can see you smile!
...okay, so apparently the authors are stalking me
Did you hear about the player who was so freaked out that when she was attacked by a few mobs she forgot to use her sword?\n*What a noob*.
...This literally isn't a joke. This is what it looks like when a sense of humour commits seppuku. The only difference is that there's no dignity to be maintained by this book.
Did you hear about the noob who spent the first few minutes of nightfall running around without any weapons?\n*It wasn't long before she was destroyed*.
I love the full stop in the answer. Not even the joke book can muster any enthusiasm about this awful punchline.
Did you hear about the noob who changed the words to Taio Cruz's song "Dynamite" so that it mentions Minecraft?\n*Her popularity has exploded all over the internet*.
Am I just old? Who the hell is Taio Cruz? And how is this a joke about noobs? One word does not a noob joke make!
Did you hear about the noob whose favorite block is air?\n*Nothing happened!*
If nothing happened, why are you telling us
You might be a noob if you think those hissing voices are coming fron an Ender Dragon.
Are you telling me dragons don't make a hissing noise? I mean, they're practically snakes with wings...\nI'm going to stop arguing with this book.
**What did one player say to his girlfriend who fell into a volcano?**\n"I _lava_ you!"
"The pact will soon be fulfilled, darling!"\n"Let's join the dark lord together, my love!"
**Why couldn't the hippie be saved from drowning?**\nHe was too far out.
Haha, this one actually made me laugh. But how is it a Minecraft joke, and does the target audience even know what a hippie is?
Did you hear about the player who tried to irritate a bunch of slimes?\n*She's still trying to wash them off of her, but her skin is really smooth!*
I'm pretty sure I saw a hentai with this plot once
There once was player named Marie.\nShe ran from a creeper and scraped a knee.\nHe pushed her in lava.\nShe hit him with a guava.\nShe's lucky because she broke free!
Nice rhyme with "lava" there, guys. You wrote this when you needed some "java" in your system?
**What did the player say to the guardian when he was fleeing from the ocean?**\n"Sea ya later!"
An entire double-page of fucking awful puns. You're welcome that I spared you the five other pages, identical to this one.
If you tell a joke in the Forest Biome and nobody laughs, was it a joke?
Not if it's from this goddamn book, that's for sure
**What's funnier than a baby zombie pigman?**\nA baby zombie pigman dressed up a Notch!
Are baby zombie pigmen funny at all? I feel like if I saw the reanimated carcass of some monstrous half-piglet, I'd be running and screaming like I was in a Goosebumps book.
**Who is a wither skeleton jockey's favorite** **_Star Trek_** **character?**\nBones.
How... esoteric. Do the writers really think kids know who Bones is?
**What did the creeper say when he nearly got shot by a player's arrow?**"Wow; that was an _arrow_ escape."
This joke is literally in the first comic strip ever published, in Victorian England. That's how recycled these jokes are
**How did the player keep from getting hurt while battling a blaze?**\nHe used a potion of fire resistance!
This is like one of those anti-jokes, isn't it? The ones where the joke comes from how much it isn't a fucking joke? Well, I can do those too!\nQ: Why is a raven like a writing desk?\nA: It isn't.\nGive me a medal for comedy
**How could the creeper tell that the invisible player was right in front of him?**\nFrom his farts!
Nothing but high-class humour in the Minecraft Joke Book
Don't apply logic\nWhen mixing new splash potions--\nThat's what Jeb will say!
Wh... what?\nDoes... Jeb Bush play Minecraft...?
**Why did the Minecraft player label the rabbit?**\nHe wanted a piece of toast.
...label...\n...toast...\n...rabbit...\n...what?
**Do you know what a good Minecraft balanced diet is?**\nA cookie in each hand!
Oh, I get it! I know how to write Minecraft jokes now!\nQ: Why did the Minecraft chicken cross the Minecraft road?\nA: To get to the other Minecraft side Minecraft!\nI should write one of these, it'd only take a day
**What do you get when you cross a cat with a squid?**\n*Cat-amari*!
NAAAAAA NANANA NANA NAA NAA NA\nKATAMARI DAMASHIIIIIIIII
**If there was a noational anthem for Minecraft, what would it be?**\n"I will survive!"
I'm sure glad one of us will, because I sure won't
**What does Taylor Swift sing when she plays Minecraft and eats potatoes?**\n"Taters gonna tate!"
Well that doesn't date this trash at all.\n...What am I saying? This book is already so dated, it thinks the Raj is a nice holiday destination.
**How does Guy Fiere make the best pickles?**\nHe uses Herobrine!
I feel like this joke might make me chortle if I had the slightest clue who Guy Fieri was
Knock, knock\n**Who's there?**\nYou're a diamond?\n**You're a diamond who?**\nYou're a _diamond_ me crazy!
Remember when you were young\nYou shone like the sun\nShiiiiiine on you craaaaaaaaazy diamond
**Why did the mom help her child create a Minecraft version of Iron Man?**\nIt was character building.
This one came dangerously close to being a good joke. Luckily it was beaten to death shortly before it escaped mediocrity
**First player:** "My login password is CreeperGhastSteveandAlex."\n**Second player:** "Why is it so long?"\n**First player:** "It has to have at least four characters."
jesus this is bad
**What did President Obama say the first time he played Minecraft?**\nWho knows? the press never covers the really important stuff.
biting political commentary from the minds that brought you invisible fart jokes
**What did the zombie say when he pulled down the Enderman's trousers?**\n*Ender*pants!
Oh, yeah, I'm sure you had to italicise "Ender". It's not like your target audience is so stupid that they couldn't spot that...\n...Never mind.
**What do you get when an Ender Dragon sneezes?**\nOut of the way!\n**Where do you go when an Ender Dragon farts?**\nFar, far away!
YOU TALENTLESS HACKS. IT'S THE SAME JOKE TWICE! IT'S THE SAME GODDAMN JOKE!\nthis book is going to be the end of me.\nAh, well... at least they wouldn't be stupid enough to repeat a joke twice, a second time.
**Why did the Minecraft player continue to play football with a broken leg?**\nHe was waiting to respawn.\n**Why didn't the Minecraft player immediately text back her friend?**\nShe was waiting to respawn!
...shunuvabitch
**What did the Minecraft player wish for?**\nTo respawn as Steve!
Steve? Which Steve? Steve Buscemi? Steven Spielberg? Steve, the guy who owns the pizza shop two doors down?\nif Steve is a real character, don't tell me, I don't care.
**What's a Minecraft player's favorite song?**\n"Karma Chameleon," because players keep on coming and going.
Hopefully they keep going past this book in a bookshop
**What did the creeper say to the respawned player?**\n"I think we've met before!"
Don't creepers, um, explode? So... how could it talk to a respawned player? And why the fuck am I questioning this book?
**What movie don't Minecraft players get?**\nThe James Bond movie, _You only Live Twice_.
You know what? I would actually believe that this book's target audience had never heard of YOLT, and therefore needed the clarification that it is a Bond film.\nWhat I wouldn't believe is anyone being stupid enough to write a joke that the target audience wouldn't get into a jokebook.
You might be a Minecraft addict if you argue with your science teacher, who says trees really do have roots and branches.
there are pages and pages of this crap
You might be a Minecraft addict if you write Minecraft fanfiction for your English essay.\nYou might be a Minecraft addict if you've read and critiqued other Minecraft players' fanfiction.
Haha, there isn't really Minecraft fanfiction, is there? Of course not, right, guys?\nguys?
You might be a Minecraft addict if you petition your school to add Swedish as a language requirement.\nYou might be a Minecraft addict if you study Swedish with the goal of getting updates faster.
Why would knowing Swedish get you updates faster? I mean, I know Notch is Swedish, but... knowing a language doesn't put you in that country. I speak Japanese, but that doesn't mean I can walk down the street and get mobbed by people calling me their "waifu"
You might be a Minecraft addict if you refuse to make eye contact with tall people dressed in black.
This just seems like good advice. If I ever run into a tall person dressed entirely in black, I'm getting the hell out of there
You might be a Minecraft addict if you admire your friend's skin and ask her where she crafted it.
you might also be a serial killer
You might be a Minecraft addict if you don't understand why you can't carry all of the groceries in one trip.
"Honey, can you help with the groceries?"\n"Sorry, mum, I'm a Minecraft addict. Can't help you."
